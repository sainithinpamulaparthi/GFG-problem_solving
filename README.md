# GFG-DSA-Practice

This repository is dedicated to daily problem-solving practice from **GeeksforGeeks**.  
It contains solutions implemented in **Java**, focusing on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  

The goal of this repository is to improve problem-solving skills, enhance coding efficiency, and build a strong foundation in core DSA concepts.  
Each problem is organized by topic, such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming.  

Solutions include clear explanations and comments to illustrate the logic and approach used.  
This repository also serves as a personal log to track progress over time.  

Regular practice through this collection helps in preparing for **competitive programming contests** and **technical interviews**.  
By solving a variety of problems, the repository aims to strengthen analytical thinking and algorithmic understanding.  

This is a continuous effort to maintain a growing library of DSA solutions and to cultivate consistent coding habits.
